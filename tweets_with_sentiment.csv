1/ Hey, guys. Today we’re gonna take a look at the top 3 sectors to watch out for ahead of the Union Budget 2023 announcement on Feb 1. 

A thread 🧵

2/ Infra: 
The Indian infrastructure sector is made up of transportation, water and sanitation and urban infrastructure. They are essential for connecting people and driving business, making them the engines of growth and development.

3/ For example, imagine a Govt investing in infrastructure projects, it creates jobs and income for people, who in turn have more money to spend on other things, generating more jobs and income for other people in the process. This chain reaction is called the multiplier effect. 

4/ The GOI has been pouring massive investments to upgrade and modernize the country’s infrastructure. Last year, they announced that they will spend a whopping Rs 7.5 lakh crore to build new roads, homes, dams, and other projects.

However, if you try to read the chart, it does not seems to show any signs of bullishness.  
IMO, retailers can get trap here, i see it going a bit more down, till 2240 zone.  
Reasons of saying so- 
1. Look at the 2 highlighted volume candles, it looks like someone is exiting in huge quantity. 
2. If it was suppose to bounce, it would have bounced straight away, without spending 10 days at support, may be its making base to fall, trapping the retailers. 
3. It has formed a double top pattern from 2800 zone.  
4. It is taking resistance from previous support area (see blue area). This area previously also worked as key level- see circled areas.

IMO, retailers can get trap here, i see it going a bit more down, till 2240 zone. Reasons of saying so- 1. Look at the 2 highlighted volume candles, it looks like someone is exiting in huge quantity. 2. If it was suppose to bounce, it would have bounced straight away, without spending 10 days at support, may be its making base to fall, trapping the retailers. 3. It has formed a double top pattern from 2800 zone. 4. It is taking resistance from previous support area (see blue area). This area previously also worked as key level- see circled areas. 5.

* It is also focusing on niche under-penetrated segments like Gold Loans and Wealth Management. Its Payment Acceptance Points network has also seen rapid growth.
* QoQ loan growth was somewhat muted, largely due to underwhelming growth on the corporate side as pricing in the marketplace is not as remunerative due to elevated competition.

""HDFCB's stock has been under pressure over the past 6M due to narrative bias. However, the fundamentals remain sound. Current valuations offer the opportunity to generate 22%+ CAGR over the next 5Y."" - Ankit Agrawal, CFA (Yellowstone Equity)

Key Points:

* Excluding auto sector and two-wheeler loans, HDFCB's retail book grew 25% YoY in Q1FY23. As the supply chain disruptions recede, HDFCB's retail book growth could surprise on the upside.
* HDFC Bank (HDFCB IN) is also making decent progress in its digitization upgrades which should further bolster the growth and productivity.

""TCS reported weaker than expected growth and margins in Q4FY23. Demand environment saw some slowdown led by the banking crisis in North America."" - Ankit Agrawal, CFA (Yellowstone Equity)

Key Points:
* TCS reported weaker than expected growth and margins. YoY growth in constant currency (CC) terms came in at just 10.7%. Operating Margin (OPM) came in at 24.1% vs 25% expected.
* North America in particular has seen some demand slowdown, largely due to deferment of discretionary projects and delayed decision making. Europe is improving as energy crisis is receding.
* Looking forward, Europe, in particular UK, is likely to lead the growth. North America may also come back as the banking crisis there seems to have been contained.

""TCS reported decent Q2FY23 earnings. The demand and margin outlook is also resilient despite recessionary fears in US and Europe. However, the stock is trading close to the fair valuation."" - Ankit Agrawal, CFA (Yellowstone Equity)

Key Points:
* Demand environment remains robust despite recessionary fears in US and Europe. Demand is being driven by structural factors like shift in the business model towards enterprise-wide digital transformation.
* One of the biggest headwinds - attrition - has now peaked and is trending downwards. Job market has cooled off and salaries of new hires have become reasonable.
* While the demand outlook and margin guidance is resilient, we estimate that the current valuations are fairly pricing the optimism. Projected IRRs are likely to be subdued from here on.

Nifty IT index has tumbled 16% so far in the current financial year. Key factors that have presented headwinds for the much-storied sector are slowing global economic growth and heavy cost pressures arising from the hiring side; the combination of which has eroded bottom lines for IT firms. 
However, what could provide some much-needed support to the sector is the very phenomenon that has roiled equity markets across the globe – rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.

The price may just have made a fresh lower high last week. Three reasons why I think so: 
 
1) The price appears to have taken resistance at the falling trendline. 
 
2) It opened below previous week's close and is now set to close below the previous week's open with a no lower wick so far, a small upper wick and a sufficiently large bearish candle. 
 
3) The price is reverting from the 61.8 Fib retracement from the previous swing high to swing low. 
 
If bears take hold again, we might see a retest of 17k - 16900. Reversal from there might suggest a broad trading range between 18400 and 17000.

Any formation of a negative pattern aka rejection before 17200 aka Lower High formation can trigger selling pressure. The more the price nearer to 17200, the better the risk reward gets for PE entries.

""Medanta reported highest ever quarterly revenue of INR7B, up 19% in Q3. All the key performance indicators recorded solid growth. The company plans to add 1,000–1,500 beds in next 2–3 years."" - Tina Banerjee

Key Points:
* Global Health (Medanta) (MEDANTA IN) reported double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, and net profit during Q3 and 9MFY23, driven by increasing footfalls, rising ARPOB, and faster-than-expected ramp-up of new hospitals.
* The company plans to add 1,000–1,500 beds in next 2–3 years, with ~70% of the planned bed addition being at existing hospitals, thereby entailing lower capex per bed.
* Recently, Medanta has announced a new asset light partnership to launch a 300-bed hospital in Indore under operations and management arrangement. The hospital is expected to commence operation in FY27.

Bottomline: 
Nifty50 may extend its decline further, with most of the Indicators and Oscillators in charts exhibiting  
further weakness with the supports near the 17280 and 17090 regions. In the past two sessions, retail  
investors have surprisingly increased their Bullish bet in Indices, in the Derivatives Segment whereas  
The FII and the PRO have increased their bearish position. The SEBI report published a few days back  
shows that almost 90% of Retail lose money in Derivatives, so the probability of Indices remaining  
bearish until the positions are squared up remains high.

Bottomline: 
Nifty50 declined to its support of the lower boundary of its channel drawn from joining its low of 16747.7 on 30 September 2022 to the low of 16956.95 on 13th October 2022. It also has the support of downward sloping corrective channel. In short, yesterday’s low is the significant point for this trend to continue upside. 
The break of yesterday’s low will take it to its support level of 18137.7 and 17969 which is the major support for this rally. The indicators and oscillator on the chart are still not confirming that the correction is complete.

Around 80% of Nifty constituents advanced this week while the top gainers were HDFC Life and Apollo Hospital. Nifty PSU Bank Index was the top sectoral gainer this week up 5% and Nifty IT continued its 4th consecutive positive streak.

🎯 The bulls were in total control triggered by a drop in crude prices, a falling dollar index, declining bond yields, and FII buying.

$NIFTY50.NSE had closed with a positive note on Monday with a Doji on daily chart but the momentum indicators are still showing strength which suggest that a Doji could have been just a pause to trend and not reversal. As we could notice in the chart, Index has been travelling into a upside channel since the low in mid-October and it seems to be sustaining without breaking out on either side. For today resistance on upside is at 18440 while support is at 18136 which can act as trailing SL to LONG positions. Though ultimate support where one should go short would be below 18050. To sum up, Hold your longs with trailing SL at 18136 and one can book some profits at 18440 while shorts can be initiated only if we close below 18050.

""Inclusion comes at a time when the group is 'seriously over leveraged,' and its numerous investments in capital-intensive sectors could present long-term dangers to investors. Analysts have noted pressure on the conglomerate's credit ratings and profits,"" Goud said.

#Nifty has been volatile in recent days and also confusing for high beta traders but during such course it has formed an upside channel. If you could notice the lows on channel, they are also perfectly taking support at 5 and 10 DSMA  (red-blue line) on closing basis since the channel has been formed. Talking about indicators, RSI has been trending steady over 50 mark since last two sessions while MACD has given confirmation of long side momentum by trading above 0 level mark on the scale. So for traders, now its a simple strategy to follow the road on channel which means SL is at 16000 mark while targets on upside can be at at 16540/16780.

Breakout from channel on SGX Nifty 
 
Interestingly, today i was looking at SGX Nifty charts and spotted a downward sloping channel breakout on hourly charts. Breakout was at the level of 16125 today morning while it was also a move above 5hours SMA which was acting as strong resistance at same level yesterday. Another factor supporting bulls ride is that SGX Nifty has started travelling in upside channel already which has now resistance at 16171 above which a new rally would be initiated. Indicators on hourly chart are supporting bulls momentum too as RSI is charging above 50 mark while MACD is about to cross 0 line from negative territory to positive.  
 
So to sum up, Nifty is expected to stay bullish today but a small resistance is at 16171 above which we could see new highs on hourly chart. But i recommend to keep strict stop loss at 16090 on the downside for traders.

New Margin rules from 01-09-2021

SEBI margin rules explain in layman’s language:

SEBI has changed some rules related to margin and trading. 

1) Buying and selling of shares will Require Upfront margin from now onwards.

Eg: If you want to buy Reliance shares worth 1lakh, you must have 20k Rs in your account as cash and the rest money to be paid within 2 days...

👆🏻 Major Change If you want to sell 1 lac worth of Reliance shares from your holdings for that scenario also you must have min 20k rs in your account. Failing which penalties will be levied.

👆🏻 Read Carefully... Selling from holding will also require Upfront margin in cash (Var+ELM).

You can keep extra cash or can pledge other holdings for the stipulated margin required.

""The Rukus around Hindustan Unilever Limited's increase in royalty payments to its parent Unilever appears to be just Noise."" - Pranav Bhavsar (India Independent Insight)

Key Points:
* Hindustan Unilever (HUVR IN)'s strong quarterly performance was overshadowed by a proposed hike in royalty payments to parent Unilever PLC (ULVR LN) 
* HUVR's historical royalty growth has been below revenue and PBT growth and hence does not generate any red flags in terms of minority shareholder protection.  
* While the impact on EPS is ~3%, we believe much of the reaction around HUVR's Royalty is Noise.

Bank Nifty has been a outperformer in recent rally in last 6 months but now it seems it gonna break down from the channel too.

One strong factor supporting my downside view is that Index has closed below 200 Day Average (Yellow line) for 6th Consecutive session which means weakness. Indicators i.e., MACD and RSI, have already shown bearish crossover of its average. Secondly, index is consecutively trading below short term moving averages 5 and 10 day SMA.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept its policy rates and accommodative stance unchanged in today’s meeting. It held economic recovery post second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was still nascent and maintained that the shadow of rising inflation would pass. But its announcement of greater absorption of surplus liquidity through variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) operations could be read as the beginning of its imminent exit from unconventional monetary easing.

The RBI has reiterated its support to economic recovery as of now by maintaining low rates and conducive financial conditions. However, with growth expected to gain momentum in the second half of this fiscal, and inflation remaining elevated, we expect monetary policy to tighten in the coming months. The US Federal Reserve is also expected to begin tapering bond purchases by end-2021, further reducing scope for the RBI to continue its present policy stance.
